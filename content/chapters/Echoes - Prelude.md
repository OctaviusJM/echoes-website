"The scientists, the governments, the media.
— They all said the same thing:  

That the heat was rising.  
That Earth’s ice caps were melting.  
That human activity was to blame — our pollution, growth.

But the world turned: drastically colder...
It was analysed: recorded, yet ignored.
Data insufficient — so they claimed.

Climate: a cog in motion, ever tumbling — clicking onward.
Northern, Southern hemispheres — compressed.
Critical shortages — time lost.

The collective spirit of mankind — fractured.
Great migrations, escalation into conflicts.
Hollowed in disbelief — displaced, reduced... lost.

The blame was shifted around in asset liquidity.  
Those ones who knew — made it profitable.
— And drained what they could.
They built data fortresses, achieved synthetic ascendance.
Their minds uploaded, and life itself — became copyrighted.

Only few: strong, stubborn.
Devised archologies — remained strict and proud."

Distant future: planet Earth — pale blue sphere.  
Veiled in a slow, unfolding carpet of snow and frost.  
Marching icebergs creak in chilling harmony.  
Their language heard over vast expanses — bearing a message.  
Once lush landscapes: now swallowed, changing, uninhabitable.
— It looks almost lonely.  
Around it, an orbit — ring filled with debris and refuse...

In space: an international scientific station orbits.  
Spherical at its core — surrounded by an outer ring. 
Tubes crossing its intersections, binding the entire structure together.
— Its colour: white — shining and bright, a true marvel of engineering. 

Inside: The station's gravity generator hums gently, protecting the crew from the toll of zero gravity.  
The interiors look clinical and bright — function over form, most importantly: pristine.
Artificial biomes hum behind glass — replicas of Earth’s forests, deserts, jungles. 
Various animals pace within cages, unaware they are mere blueprints for something far greater — 
beyond their primal instincts.

Aboard it: multinational groups of top scientists are working diligently.
— Ever more exhausted with each passing day, running behind schedule.
Their mission: to solve the problems of planetary settlement.
By redefining ecosystems to match Earth’s.

There is a long hallway — stretching around.  
Laid out with neatly ordered small vats and tubes — perfectly labelled.  
Each holding earthly specimens — intensely studied, aiding their objective.

At the centre: a large rounded room filled with computers and screens —  
each beeping in the same droning, rhythmic pulse.
They flicker and glow abruptly — graphs flowing upward in expanding waves.  
Calculations surge. Structures emerge, evolving in rapid succession.

And at the very heart: 
An ageing man with greying, neatly combed hair stands.  
His lab coat proper, stiff and spotless — fully composed. 
— The main leader of the project.
For a moment he's staring at an heirloom — in his hand, an image of his loved ones.  
Clutching it dearly, reminiscing of days past... what never lasted.

"Another subject has collapsed!"  
A scientist’s voice — distant, strained — echoes from the far side of the station.  
— As they rush towards one of the holding pens.
Attending to one of many animals — in distress.

His attention now demanded — heart beating rapidly.  
He leans over a glowing screen, frowning — his charcoal eyes locked in place.  
— Cold monitor light from below reflects in his irises.
Next to him a test sample, within — a tiny little grain, suspended, gently vibrating.
The programme’s procedure: converging towards completion...  
"Almost done. First successful specimen."
"It's finally stable." — he smirks.
— The tiny little grain now motionless.  

He picks up a communication device. Makes a call.
Cold synthetic voice answers: "Speak up."
"We may finally be able to proceed to the next stage." — he utters, voice steady.
The elusive executive: "It took long enough. Very well — no more delays."
Call ends: cut sudden. He puts the device back — shaking.
"We can't afford to delay any more now."

For a split second — golden sunlight glimmers through the station’s elliptical visors.  
Briefly turning the interior into gold.
He looks to it, basking in its radiance — a moment of glory nonetheless.

*Suddenly the droning sounds of the station fade into the void.*
A shattering noise — skull-piercing crack tore through.  
Violent rumble, the station reeled — now haunted.  
Structure deformed. Pressure destabilising. Oxygen levels falling.
— The scientist's body slams onto the floor.
Alarms ripple throughout: fierce, rapturing — fires erupt.  
Animals revolt in havoc, attempting to break out from their cells.  
Their tormenting howls, violent screeching — tear through the alarms.

He struggles to raise his head, his ears ringing; his vision blurred.  
Radiance he enjoyed moments ago: now blinding.  
Left arm dislocated — pulsating, creeping pain.  
As he quickly glances to assess: cold sweat follows, shivers slice across the spine.
The station: pierced, by an object of unknown origin.
The rest of the team — scattered, isolated.  
(Their voices silent.)

His mind gallops — primal, fuelled by adrenaline — "It's too late. It can't be stopped."
He rips the test sample: labelled “UNUS” from the console port — bolts through the nearest airlock.  
Boards an escape pod. Barely conscious, now exhausted — gasping rapidly.
As he’s ejected towards Earth: he catches a quick glimpse.  
The station, ruptured by an old orbital debris — a derelict from days of old... 
It's twisting and eroding, no longer whole.
— He exhales and lowers his head.  
"This is how it ends... by just mere debris" — agonising weight to bear.  
"At least the sample may survive."  
"Humanity’s shining last hope: erased, our incompetence."  
— Now aching, deeper agony unravels.

The pod plunges through the atmosphere: blazing orange gradient, trailing sparks like falling embers.
— He curls inside, bracing for impact.
Flaps eject outward to stabilise the turbulence…  
Onboard computer initiates deployment of the parachute.  
*beep*, *warning* — a digitised feminine voice announces — *beep*, *warning*: “Parachute deployment has failed.” 
The computer malfunctions: system scrambled.
What's left of his composure — stirred again.  
He frantically presses the button to deploy backup: it springs open, his reaction too hesitant. 

The pod smashes into the ground. It met its destiny too fast — critically damaged, its descent scarcely slowed.
— Silence, dust rises.
Suddenly: hand strikes the door from the inside.
Second time... — Pause. Third time.
It opens — reverberating a metallic song.  
What remains of the heat-absorbing plating: falls to the ground, disintegrating into ash.
He attempts to move... his body — imprisoned inside the shell.  
In a desperate attempt: he gasps for air, as the fumes intensify.  
Finally bearing witness of his surroundings.

The sunset casts its light over a greying grassy landscape dotted with snow.  
The surrounding flora carries mournful undertones.  
Leafless willows droop, twisting gently in the wind.  
Above: the falling remnants of the space station litter the sky.
— For all to witness far and wide.

The sky's embers reflect in his charcoal eyes, each dragging a supernova’s tail.
There is an odd stillness — the world stood still in that exact moment.
— The gentle breeze carries approaching cold...
He loses consciousness: the body yields — in futility.  
The sample he held onto so dearly... slips from his hand — it shatters between his feet.

The stillness breaks. No: it begins to rattle.
The willows now weeping with crystalline tears.  
Forced to witness something never meant to be seen.

As it slithers inside — moments pass. 
His body starts... dissolving.
Now: a pool of organic sludge — unrecognisable.
Slowly, deliberately — something emerges.
It is crouched, motionless — frail, uncanny.   

The muscle tissue weaves across the skeletal figure.
Stretching — snapping into place.
Its skin pale, stretched like cobweb over crude physique.
No nose or mouth. Eyes — white, rotten yellow.
Irises fixated in place: utterly still.
— Not quite right: merely cruel imitation.

Elastic tendrils snap away like stretched synaptic nerves.
Merging back into the mass: the new form — it is awake. 

Beneath the figure:
Mass begins to spread — root-like formation, pulsating in waves.  
And it expands ever so... as a web, entangling the ground.  
The earth turns hostile and barren, void of life.
Even the poor bacteria — none spared; insects — just a starter.
Behind: a family necklace — all that's left; everything else absorbed. Efficient.
Wreckage — terminal symptom. Now cold.

A new beginning — or an end of everything.  

— Or perhaps both.
